    "\n",
    "The way we initialise in `neos` is to define functions that make a statistical model from histograms, which in turn are themselves made from a predictive model, such as a neural network. Here's some detail on the unctions used below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `hists_from_nn_three_blobs(predict)` uses the nn decision function `predict` defined in the cell above to form histograms from signal and background data, all drawn from multivariate normal distributions with different means. Two background distributions are sampled from, which is meant to mimic the situation in particle physics where one has a 'nominal' prediction for a nuisance parameter and then an alternate value (e.g. from varying up/down by one standard deviation), which then modifies the background pdf. Here, we take that effect to be a shift of the mean of the distribution. The value for the background histogram is then the mean of the resulting counts of the two modes, and the uncertainty can be quantified through the count standard deviation.\n",
    "- `nn_hepdata_like(hmaker)` uses `hmaker` to construct histograms, then feeds them into the `neos.models.hepdata_like` function that constructs a pyhf-like model. This can then be used to call things like `logpdf` and `expected_data` downstream.\n",
    "- `cls_maker` takes a model-making function as it's primary argument, which is fed into functions from `neos.fit` that minimise the `logpdf` of the model in both a constrained (fixed parameter of interest) and a global way. Moreover, these fits are wrapped in a function that allows us to calculate gradients through the fits using *fixed-point differentiation*. This allows for the calculation of both the profile likelihood and its gradient, and then the same for cls :)\n",
    "\n",
    "All three of these methods return functions. in particular, `cls_maker` returns a function that differentiably calculates CLs values, which is our desired objective to minimise."
